### Description ###

My grandmother often requires help with her Windows computer.  Explaining instructions to her is often a frustrating process, so I decided to write a script which would allow me to control her computer from anywhere.  This script would be better other alternatives because it would be web based.  That way, I would be able to help her wherever I was, no matter what platform I was using.

This project was an idea at a Hackathon.  I wrote the whole thing myself in about 12 hours, so please forgive me for horrible coding practices and meaningless naming conventions.

### Usage ###

On the computer being controlled, use:

py serverend.py
py compend.py

Then navigate to the broadcast url on the controlling computer to control the mouse.
